        <h1>About SerøCore</h1>
        <p>
            SerøCore is more than a website — it's an archive of untold truths, raw voices, and unheard human stories. 
            Built by Achamo Opara, a soul forged in resilience, this platform stands to give voice to those who never had one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Born from the fire of the Anuak genocide, SerøCore is a place for rebirth — for finding strength in silence and purpose in pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is just the beginning. Stories live here now. Stories that matter.
